# snap-game

Snap game - can be played in single-player or multiplayer mode. In single-player mode, the player simply presses Enter to deal a new card and the game ends when two consecutive cards have the same value. In multiplayer mode, each player enters their name and they take turns to press Enter and deal a card. If a player deals a card with the same value as the previous card and inputs "snap" before two seconds are up, that player wins. Otherwise the game continues.
